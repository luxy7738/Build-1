                    Hibiscus tea, also known as "roselle" or "sorrel" in various parts of the world, is an infusion made from the vibrant crimson petals of the hibiscus flower (Hibiscus sabdariffa). This tart and refreshing herbal tea has gained popularity for its striking color, unique flavor profile, and potential health benefits.

                    The hibiscus tea-making process involves steeping dried hibiscus petals in hot water, which imparts a brilliant red hue to the liquid. The taste is often described as tangy and slightly tart, with notes of cranberry and citrus. It can be enjoyed both hot and cold and is frequently sweetened to balance its natural tartness.

It is rich in vitamin C and packed with antioxidants, making it a favorite choice for those seeking a natural way to support their immune system. Additionally, some studies suggest that hibiscus tea may aid in managing blood pressure and promoting heart health.
